# Introduction
The Automated Student Registration System is a web-based application that aims to simplify the registration process for students and the creation of batches by administrators in an educational institution. The system allows students to sign up, select a course, and register themselves for a specific batch. Administrators can manage courses, batches, and students' information through a user-friendly interface.
